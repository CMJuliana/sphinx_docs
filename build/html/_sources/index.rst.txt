Sphinx Automation Demo
=========================

This repository is a small, complete example of a technical documentation workflow built with:

- AsciiDoc for authoring
- Docker for consistent local builds
- GitHub Actions for automated conversion to HTML
- GitHub Pages for public hosting

It is designed as a portfolio piece to demonstrate:

Technical writing using AsciiDoc
Ability to structure and organize multi-file documentation
Understanding of automated documentation pipelines
Experience working with CI/CD workflows
Knowledge of GitHub Actions and Pages deployment

Add your content using ``reStructuredText`` syntax. See the
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
documentation for details.
